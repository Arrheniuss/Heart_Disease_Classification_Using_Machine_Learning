# Heart Disease Classification Using Machine Learning

This project involves a machine learning approach to heart disease classification, implemented in Google Colab with Python. The models used include:
- CatBoost
- ExtraTreesClassifier
- RandomForestClassifier
- KNeighborsClassifier (KNN)
- LogisticRegression
- GaussianNB
- Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
- DecisionTreeClassifier
- AdaBoostClassifier
- QuadraticDiscriminantAnalysis (QDA)
Data visualization was conducted using Seaborn and Matplotlib libraries to enhance data - insights and interpretability.
