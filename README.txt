Heart Disease Classification Using Machine Learning
This project involves a machine learning approach to heart disease classification, implemented in Google Colab with Python. The models used include:

CatBoost
ExtraTreesClassifier
RandomForestClassifier
KNeighborsClassifier (KNN)
LogisticRegression
GaussianNB
Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
DecisionTreeClassifier
AdaBoostClassifier
QuadraticDiscriminantAnalysis (QDA)
Data visualization was conducted using Seaborn and Matplotlib libraries to enhance data insights and interpretability.
